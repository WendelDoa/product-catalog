# Product Catalog

## Description 📃
>This is an OOP project created by me in the Java language, with the implementation of a PostgreSQL database using a Java library to make the connection called JDBC. In this system I used the simple graphical interface that was JFRAME. The project has in its folder the postgreSQL jdbc driver, the UML diagram made in astah and a txt file with future improvements.

## Some warnings about the project ❗
+ The ids of each product are registered uniquely, that is, if you register an id and then delete it, you will not be able to create another product with the same id.
+ The Update function does not work, it has been left for possible future implementation

## How it works ❔
+ You can register products
+ You can delete products
+ You can search for products
+ You must click the Save catalog button to save the changes to add new products
+ When deleting a product, it is not necessary to use the Save catalog button, as it is automatically updated

## How to run the application ❔
1) Download all files
2) Remember to configure the postgreSQL drive available in the project folder!
3) Remember, you must have a PostgreSQL database with the same name provided in the application and with equivalent tables!
4) After making all the necessary configurations, run the main class and enjoy 😁
